Here is a code in Python that retrieves carbon emission data and energy demand data from an online source and forecasts both using the ARIMA algorithm in the statsmodels library:
In this code, the carbon emission data and energy demand data are first retrieved from online sources using the pd.read_csv function. The data is then converted into time series format using the set_index method. The ARIMA algorithm is then fit to the data using the ARIMA function from the statsmodels library. The models are then used to forecast the carbon emissions and energy demand for the next 5 years. The forecasted values are then printed to the console.
Note that this code assumes that the data is available in a specific format and that the ARIMA algorithm is an appropriate choice for the data. It may need to be modified or optimized based on the specific requirements and characteristics of the data.
